          <p>Indian Higher Education is in need of radical reforms. A focus on enforcing higher standards of transparency, strengthening of the vocational and doctoral educational pipeline and professionalization of the sector through stronger institutional responsibility would help in re-prioritizing efforts towards excellence. To achieve this aim MHRD has taken an initiative to establish a ranking agency for quality assessment. </p>
          <br>
		  <p>The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) was launched on 29th September 2015 by MHRD to rank Higher Educational Institutions in the Country based on objective, verifiable criteria to promote competitive excellence in the higher educational institutions. For the use of the participating institutions (institutes accredited/affiliated to the AICTE/UGC) a web based platform has been set up, in which the institutions are invited to register themselves.</p> 
		  <br>
		  <p>Ranking promotes competition among the Universities and drives them to strive for excellence. The rankings assume significance as performance of institutions has been linked with “Institutions of Eminence” scheme. Only Higher Educational Institutions currently placed in the top 500 of Global Rankings or top 50 of the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) are eligible to apply for the eminence tag. Institutions with the eminence tag would be allowed greater autonomy without having to report to the University Grants Commission (UGC). They would be able to admit foreign students and recruit faculty from abroad, and follow a flexible course and fee structure to enable them to vault to the ranks of the top Global Institution. The private Institutions of Eminence can also come up as ‘greenfield ventures’ - provided the sponsoring organization submits a convincing perspective plan for 15 years.</p>
		  <br>
		  <p>The parameters used for ranking broadly cover :</p>
		<ul>
		
			<li>Teaching, Learning & Resources (30% Weight in Total Score)</li>
			<li>Research and Professional Practice (30% Weight in Total Score )</li>
			<li>Graduation Outcomes (20% Weight in Total Score)</li>
			<li>Outreach and Inclusivity (10% Weight in Total Score)</li>
			<li>Perception (10% Weight in Total Score)</li>
			
		</ul>
		<p>The Educational Institutions across the Country were ranked in nine categories –Overall, Universities, Engineering, Colleges, Management, Pharmacy, Medical, Architecture and Law</p>
		<br>	
		<p>As Industry and Services sector in India would require a gross incremental work force of 250 million by 2030. Given the expected socio economic scenario in 2030 India would need a robust Higher Education System that can deliver on multiple imperatives. To achieve the envisioned state in 2030 transformational and innovative interventions would be required across all levels of the Higher Education system.NIRF plays a key role in identifying the top level institutions which can occupy a prominent place among higher educational institutions globally.</p>
